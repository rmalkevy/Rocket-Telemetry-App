         * This directive accepts three attributes:
         *
         * * `ng-model`: The model for the form; where user input
         *   where be stored.
         * * `structure`: The declarative structure of the form.
         *   Describes what controls should be shown and where
         *   their values should be read/written in the model.
         * * `name`: The name under which to expose the form's
         *   dirty/valid state. This is similar to ng-form's use
         *   of name, except this will be made available in the
         *   parent scope.
