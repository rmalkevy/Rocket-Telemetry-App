         *
         *     throttle(fn, delay, [apply])
         *
         * Returns a function that, when invoked, will invoke `fn` after
         * `delay` milliseconds, only if no other invocations are pending.
         * The optional argument `apply` determines whether or not a
         * digest cycle should be triggered.
         *
         * The returned function will itself return a `Promise` which will
         * resolve to the returned value of `fn` whenever that is invoked.
         *
         * In cases where arguments are provided, only the most recent
         * set of arguments will be passed on to the throttled function
         * at the time it is executed.
         *
