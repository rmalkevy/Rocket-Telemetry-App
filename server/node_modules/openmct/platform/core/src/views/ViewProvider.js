         * A view provider allows view definitions (defined as extensions)

         * to a set that is applicable to specific domain objects. This
         * filtering is parameterized by the extension definitions
         * themselves; specifically:
         *
         * * Definitions with a `needs` property containing an array of
         *   strings are only applicable to domain objects which have
         *   all those capabilities.
         *   * If the view definition has a `delegation` property that
         *     is truthy, then domain objects which delegate capabilities
         *     from the `needs` property will be treated as having those
         *     capabilities for purposes of determining view applicability.
         * * Definitions with a `type` property are only applicable to
         *   domain object's whose `type` capability matches or inherits
         *   from that type.
         *
         * Views themselves are primarily metadata, such as name, icon and
         * description (to be shown in the UI); they do not contain any
         * information directly applicable to rendering to the DOM, although
         * they do contain sufficient information (such as a `templateUrl`,
         * used in the representation bundle) to retrieve those details.
         * The role of a view provider and of a view capability is to
         * describe what views are available, not how to instantiate them.
