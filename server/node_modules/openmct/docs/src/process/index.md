# Development Process

The process used to develop Open MCT is described in the following
documents:

* The [Development Cycle](cycle.md) describes how and when specific
  process points are repeated during development.
* The [Version Guide](version.md) describes version numbering for
  Open MCT (both semantics and process.)
* Testing is described in two documents:
  * The [Test Plan](testing/plan.md) summarizes the approaches used
    to test Open MCT.
  * The [Test Procedures](testing/procedures.md) document what
    specific tests are performed to verify correctness, and how
    they should be carried out.
